I am Di Luo, an *<a href="https://iaifi.org/" target="_blank">IAIFI</a>* fellow at the NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, as well as a postdoctoral associate at the Center for Theoretical Physics at MIT and the physics department at Harvard. I graduated with a Ph.D. degree in physics and a master degree in mathematics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2021. I received my undergraduate degree with majors in physics and mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 2016. 

In 2024, I will start as an Assistant Professor at UCLA.

## Research Interest:

I am working on research in the intersection of quantum many-body physics, quantum information science, and artificial intelligence. I have been developing machine learning approaches and quantum algorithms for fundamental physics, quantum materials, and quantum information science. I am interested in understanding nature from the perspectives of information and computation as well as developing intelligence inspired by ideas from nature.
