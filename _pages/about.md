I am Di Luo, an <a href="https://iaifi.org/" target="_blank">IAIFI</a> fellow at the NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, as well as a postdoctoral associate at MIT Center for Theoretical Physics and Harvard Physics Department. I graduated with a Ph.D. degree in physics and a master degree in mathematics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2021. I received my undergraduate degree with double majors in physics and mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 2016. 

## Research Interest:

I am working on research in AI+Science and Quantum Computation, with research topics in the intersection of quantum many-body physics, quantum information science, and artificial intelligence. I aim to understand nature from the perspectives of information and computation as well as develop intelligence inspired by ideas from nature, particulary in the following directions: 

* ***AI for Science***: develop generative models with quantum representation and efficient ML PDEs algorithms for simulations and discoveries in fundamental science, quantum materials and quantum technology.
* ***Science for AI***: utilize mathematics and physics theories to develop new representation and optimization methods for machine learning, advance AI reasoning and robotics. 
* ***Quantum Information Science***: design quantum algorithms for quantum control, quantum measurement, quantum error correction, quantum simulations and quantum machine learning.
