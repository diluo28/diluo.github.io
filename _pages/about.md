I am Di Luo, an <a href="https://iaifi.org/" target="_blank">IAIFI</a> fellow at the NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, affiliated with MIT Center for Theoretical Physics and Harvard Physics Department. I graduated with a Ph.D. degree in physics and a master degree in mathematics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2021. I received my undergraduate degree with double majors in physics and mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 2016. 

## Research Interest:

I am working on research in AI+Science and Quantum Computation, focusing on developing machine learning and quantum algorithms for scientific discoveries as well as designing new theories and framework for AI inspired by mathematics and physics. I aim to understand nature from the perspectives of information and computation as well as develop intelligence inspired by ideas from nature, particulary in the following directions: 

* ***AI for Science***: develop generative models with quantum representation and efficient ML PDEs algorithms for simulations and discoveries in fundamental science, quantum materials and quantum technology.
* ***Science for AI***: utilize mathematics and physics theories to develop new representation and optimization methods for machine learning, advance AI reasoning and robotics. 
* ***Quantum Information Science***: design efficient quantum algorithms for quantum control, quantum measurement, quantum error correction, quantum simulations and quantum machine learning.

Welcome students with background in theoretical and experimental physics, computational physics (quantum monte carlo, tensor network, DFT, MD, etc.), mathematics, chemistry, biology, quantum information science, machine learning and robotics for discussion and collaboration!
