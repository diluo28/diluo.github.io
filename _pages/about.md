I am Di Luo, a postdoctoral associate at the theoretical center of physics at MIT and the physics department at Harvard. I am an IAIFI fellow at the The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions. I received my undergraduate degree with majors in physics and mathematics from the University of Hong Kong in 2016. I graduated with master degree in mathematics and Ph.D. degree in physics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2021.

## Research Interest:

I am working on research in the intersection of quantum many-body physic, quantum information science, and artificial intelligence. I have been developing quantum algorithms and machine learning approaches for fundamental physics, quantum materials, and quantum information science. I am interested in understanding nature from the perspectives of information and computation as well as developing intelligence inspired by ideas from nature.
